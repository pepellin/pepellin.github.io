Most of my experience are about web application development on both front-end design and back-end technology. I and the team were employing Meteor to create a full stack JavaScript web application for Nationwide Children's Hospital. We did the project under agile methodology and with Git and GitHub as version control tool. Additionally, during my internship in Buckit Media, we made a project management system web application for internal use and an intranet for Wendy's based on mockups. Besides teamworks, I built an e-commerce website using J2EE and Spring framework and designed an SQL database using the SQLite engine for bookstore management.<br>I keep learning and expanding my knowledge. I am also interested in UI/UX, which will improve the interaction between developers and designers. I have made a click-through app prototype with Balsamiq and Flinto. I wrote personas, developed themes, and created high-definition wireframe. Finally, I created a user testing plan, conduct the test in a non-lab environment, and wrote a user test report.";
